Spaces are a place that : 

- can be activated and deactivated 
- users can join if logged in and if the place is active
- users will see the option to wait in line (a button to join the waiting line), 
- users will see the current queue user's list
- users will see the name of the space and the time that space has been active so far
- once the space is deactivated every user waiting in line will be removed from the queue
- each active session will be saved for future history development (how much time spent in a given space, how many users joined in the queue of that space, the user that activated the space)
- users waiting in line can pause their waiting so other users can be next
- the queue is to organize people so they can know who get's to ask a question next
- users in line can write a message once they join a waiting line, that's the preview question they will be asking

Add a button to create a new "space". The button should open a modal with a form that has an input for the name and subject for that new space. The form's submit button should have a loading state changing it's text. The space should be created in DB with name, subject (optional) and a random slug that will be used for the url path of that space so users can open it in a browser. 
Show a list of the logged user's created spaces as cards that refreshes if the user submit's a new space. Try to keep everything in a server component using Suspense and custom skeleton components for the space's cards. The button should be in a separate component, as well as the space's cards and card list and the modal. Try to accomodate the modal in a "global" place so it can be reused in the future.

The supabase query, if any, should be saved in the #file:actions.ts file.
