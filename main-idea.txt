Spaces are a place that : 

- can be activated and deactivated 
- users can join if logged in and if the place is active
- users will see the option to wait in line (a button to join the waiting line), 
- users will see the current queue user's list
- users will see the name of the space and the time that space has been active so far
- once the space is deactivated every user waiting in line will be removed from the queue
- each active session will be saved for future history development (how much time spent in a given space, how many users joined in the queue of that space, the user that activated the space)
- users waiting in line can pause their waiting so other users can be next
- the queue is to organize people so they can know who get's to ask a question next
- users in line can write a message once they join a waiting line, that's the preview question they will be asking

Add a list like the SpaceList but showing any active waiting list the logged user might be, not just the ones that were created by that user

Try to keep everything in a server component using Suspense and custom skeleton components

The supabase query, if any, should be saved in the #file:actions.ts file.
Each new DB requirement should also be written to a SQL file so I can run the queries in supabase to create/alter tables.
